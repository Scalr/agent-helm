### Technical Requirements

* Must follow [Charts best practices](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/)
* Must pass CI jobs for linting and installing changed charts with the [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tool
* Variable naming and patterns should strive to be consistent across all charts. If certain options exist in a neighboring chart, they should be added or updated in sync to maintain consistency.
* All Helm variable declarations must be documented, and the documentation must be kept up to date using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) via `make docs`.

The chart `version` follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

Thereâ€™s no need to manually change the chart version, as charts are released in sync with agent releases and version bumps are handled by automated workflows. After changes are merged, they may be further validated by internal end-to-end workflows that run before each release. Releases usually occur on a weekly basis.
