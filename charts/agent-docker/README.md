![Version: 0.5.61](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.5.61-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 0.55.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-0.55.1-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on the Kubernetes cluster,
where runs are executed in [dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) sidecar container.
Run phases are isolated into docker containers.

> [!WARNING]
> For new deployments we encourage you to try the new [`agent-local`](/charts/agent-local)
> or [`agent-k8s`](/charts/agent-k8s) charts.

## Overview

This chart uses the Scalr Agent with the `docker` driver and a Docker-in-Docker sidecar container.
Originally built to run the Docker-based Agent on Kubernetes due to the lack of native Kubernetes support.
It has been retained due to adoption challenges with the native agent-k8s chart, we recommend using the newer
[agent-local](../charts/agent-local) chart for new installations instead of agent-docker.

This Kubernetes deployment does not scale across multiple replicas. As a result, the compute capacity
managed by each agent is limited to a single node. You can run multiple separate Deployments within
the same Kubernetes cluster to increase overall capacity.

### Pros

- Simple to deploy.
- Scalr Agent service doesn’t require permissions to access the Kubernetes API.
- Includes Provider Cache and Binary Cache by default.

### Cons

- Doesn’t support autoscaling.
- Not cost-efficient for bursty workloads — e.g., deployments with high number of Runs during short periods and low activity otherwise, as resources remain allocated even when idle.
- Depends on a priviliged Docker-in-Docker service.
- Impossible to configure storage.
