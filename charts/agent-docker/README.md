![Version: 0.5.27](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.5.27-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 0.31.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-0.31.0-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on ths Kubernetes cluster,
where runs are executed in [dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) sidecar container.
Run phases are isolated into docker containers.

> **Note**
> We suggest to install this chart only is you already rely on scalr-agent,
> and migrating your AgentPool from other installation methods: e.g. rpm / deb / docker.
> For new deployments we encourage you to try the new [`agent-k8s`](/charts/agent-k8s) chart,
> that has many advantages over the `agent-docker`.

Kuberentes deployment doesn't scale on multiple replicas.
Consequently, the capacity of compute resources that can be managed
by a single agent remains constrained by a single node.

Multiple Deployments can be created within a single Kubernetes cluster.
