description: |
  A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on the Kubernetes cluster,
  where runs are executed in Pods in the same cluster.
  Run phases are isolated in kubernetes containers with resource limits.

  > **Note**
  > This new deployment architecture is currently in preview.
  > It has many advantages over the [`agent-docker`](/charts/agent-docker) chart and
  > would eventually replace it.
