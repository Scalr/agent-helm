  A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on the Kubernetes cluster,
  where runs are executed in Pods in the same cluster.
  Run phases are isolated in kubernetes containers with resource limits.

  > **Note**
  > This new deployment architecture is currently in preview.
  > It has many advantages over the [`agent-docker`](/charts/agent-docker) chart and
  > would eventually replace it.

  Agent pool DaemomSet scales up/down with the cluster, registering
  and deregistering agents from the pool. When an Agent receives a job from Scalr,
  it schedules a Pod for execution. The Kubernetes workload scheduler assigns the Pod
  to a specific Node, where the Agent running on that Node oversees the execution
  of the job. By enabling the Kubernetes auto-scaler, Terraform workloads can scale
  linearly based on the load.
