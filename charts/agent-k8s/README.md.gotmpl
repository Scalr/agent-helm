## Additional Information

The Agent deploys as two components: a controller and a worker. The controller
consumes jobs from Scalr and schedules pods, while the worker supervises the jobs.

The agent worker is a DaemonSet that scales up/down with the cluster, registering
and deregistering agents from the pool. When an Agent controller receives a job from Scalr,
it schedules a Pod for execution. The Kubernetes workload scheduler assigns the Pod
to a specific Node, where the Agent worker running on that Node oversees the execution
of the job. By enabling the Kubernetes auto-scaler, Terraform workloads can scale
linearly based on the load.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `scalr-agent`:

```console
$ helm repo add scalr-agent-helm https://scalr.github.io/agent-helm/
$ helm upgrade --install scalr-agent scalr-agent-helm/{{ template "chart.name" . }} \
    --set agent.url="https://<account>.scalr.io" \
    --set agent.token="<agent-pool-token>"
```

You can also control the placement of both the controller and the worker on the cluster using the `controllerNodeSelector`
and `workerNodeSelector` options. Here's an example using GKE specific labels:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install scalr-agent scalr-agent-helm/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
    --set agent.url="https://<account>.scalr.io" \
    --set agent.token="<agent-pool-token>" \
    --set controllerNodeSelector."kubernetes\\.io\\/hostname"="<node-name>" \
    --set workerNodeSelector."cloud\\.google\\.com\\/gke-nodepool"="<node-pool-name>"
```

To use a separate agent pool for Scalr workloads, you may want to configure [Taint and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).
Set up the taints on the Node Pool, and add tolerations to the agent worker with the `workerTolerations` option. An example:

```console
--set workerTolerations[0].operator=Equal,workerTolerations[0].effect=NoSchedule,workerTolerations[0].key=dedicated,workerTolerations[0].value=scalr-agent-worker-pool
```

## Disk Requirements

Currently, the Agent is not fully cloud-native and utilizes the [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath)
volume for storing a shared OpenTofu/Terraform plugin cache and managing configuration version artifacts
for agent task Pods.

The volume is configured via the `agent.data_home` option. The filesystem on this volume must be
writable, executable, and stateful (within the lifecycle of the Scalr Agent Pod).

### Choosing the Data Home Directory

In the default template example, the node disk is utilized at the path `/home/kubernetes/flexvolume/agent-k8s`.
This path is specific to Container-Optimized OS (GKE) and varies depending on the Kubernetes provider in use.

There is also a known [issue](https://github.com/Scalr/agent-helm/pull/32) with the default `agent.data_home` directory, which will be changed in the future.

It is recommended to alter the default directory to `/home/kubernetes/bin/scalr/{unique-name}`.

For EKS (Amazon Linux 2 or Bottlerocket OS), the recommended path is `/var/lib/{unique-name}`.

Using a unique name in the path is necessary when installing multiple agents on the cluster
to prevent collisions. Additionally, it is important to note that the Agent does not delete its
data when uninstalling the chart or modifying the `agent.data_home` option, which may result
in artifacts being left on the node's root disk.

Example of setting `agent.data_home`:

```console
$ helm upgrade ... \
    --set agent.data_home="/var/lib/{unique-name}"
```

## Amazon EFS

Amazon EFS can be used as a shared ReadWriteMany volume instead of a node disk. To configure it,
install the `Amazon EFS CSI Driver` via an add-on. See the documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html#efs-install-driver.
Ensure the add-on is active before proceeding.

Next, configure the Amazon EFS file system ID using the `efsVolumeHandle` option:

```console
$ helm upgrade ... \
    --set agent.data_home="/var/lib/{unique-name}" \
    --set efsVolumeHandle="fs-582a03f3"
    # Alternatively, if using an Access Point:
    # see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs-nfs-permissions.html#accessing-fs-nfs-permissions-access-points
    --set efsVolumeHandle="fs-582a03f3::fsap-01e050b7d9a3109d5"
```

The EFS storage will be mounted in all worker containers at the `agent.data_home` path. All child containers
for Runs will inherit the EFS configuration. The controller will continue to use an ephemeral directory
as its data home.

## Restrict Access to VM Metadata Service

The chart includes an optional feature to restrict the pods from accessing the VM metadata service at 169.254.169.254, that is common for both AWS and GCP environments.

To enable it, use the `restrictMetadataService` option:

```console
$ helm upgrade ... \
    --set restrictMetadataService=true
```

With this option enabled, a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is applied to the agent pods that denies egress traffic to 169.254.169.254/32, blocking access to the VM metadata service. All other outbound traffic is allowed.

### HTTP Proxy

To configure an HTTP proxy, set the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

Example of running agent with HTTP proxy enabled:

```console
$ helm upgrade ... \
  --set extraEnv.HTTP_PROXY="<proxy-address>" \
  --set extraEnv.HTTPS_PROXY="<proxy-address>" \
  --set extraEnv.NO_PROXY="<addr1>,<addr2>"
```

### SSL Certificate Bundles

To configure SSL certificates globally, use the `agent.ca_cert` option.
To configure SSL certificates only for isolated containers for the tasks (e.g. tofu/terraform/infracost operations), set the `agent.container_task_ca_cert` option.

You can bundle your certificate into an agent image. Place the custom CA file at `extra_ca_root.crt` and build the customized image:

```Dockerfile
FROM scalr/agent:latest

ADD extra_ca_root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra-ca.crt
RUN apt update \
    && apt install ca-certificates -y \
    && chmod 644 /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra-ca.crt \
    && update-ca-certificates
ENV SCALR_CA_CERT="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" # same as `agent.ca_cert` helm option
# ENV SCALR_CONTAINER_TASK_CA_CERT="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" # same as `agent.container_task_ca_cert` helm option
```

This step also bundles your certificate with the set of public certificates provided by `ca-certificates`
system package. You can optionally skip this step and instead point `SCALR_CA_CERT` (or `SCALR_CONTAINER_TASK_CA_CERT`) to your certificate
if it already includes public CA certificates or if they are not needed (e.g., in a setup completely hidden behind a proxy).

Note that by default, the scalr agent uses the certificate bundle provided by the [certifi](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi) package instead of the system certificate bundle provided by the `ca-certificates` package.

Alternatively, a base64-encoded string containing the certificate bundle can be used.

Example of encoding a bundle:

```console
$~ cat /path/to/bundle.ca | base64
```

Example of running agent with custom CA certifcates:

```console
$ helm upgrade ... \
  -e agent.ca_cert=<base-64-encoded-certs>
```

### Limitations

Ensure that your cluster is using a CNI plugin that supports egress NetworkPolicies. Example: Calico, Cilium, or native GKE NetworkPolicy provider for supported versions.

If your cluster doesn't currently support egress NetworkPolicies, you may need to recreate it with the appropriate settings.
