    description: 'A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on ths Kubernetes cluster,
      where runs are executed in [dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) sidecar container.
      Run phases are isolated into docker containers.  Kuberentes deployment doesn''t
      scale on multiple replicas. Consequently, the capacity of compute resources
      that can be managed by a single agent remains constrained by a single node.  Multiple
      Deployments can be created within a single Kubernetes cluster.  ![Agent in Docker

    description: 'A Helm chart for the scalr-agent deployment on the Kubernetes cluster,
      where runs are executed in Pods in the same cluster. Run phases are isolated
      in kubernetes containers with resource limits.  Agent pool DaemomSet scales
      up/down with the cluster, registering and deregistering agents from the pool.
      When an Agent receives a job from Scalr, it schedules a Pod for execution. The
      Kubernetes workload scheduler assigns the Pod to a specific Node, where the
      Agent running on that Node oversees the execution of the job. By enabling the
      Kubernetes auto-scaler, Terraform workloads can scale linearly based on the
      load.  ![Agent in Kubernetes deployment diagram](/charts/agent-k8s/assets/agent-k8s-deploy-diagram.jpg) '
