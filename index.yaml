      with the cluster, registering and deregistering agents from the pool. When an
      Agent receives a job from Scalr, it schedules a Pod for execution. The Kubernetes
      workload scheduler assigns the Pod to a specific Node, where the Agent running
      on that Node oversees the execution of the job. By enabling the Kubernetes auto-scaler,
      Terraform workloads can scale linearly based on the load.  ![Agent in Kubernetes
